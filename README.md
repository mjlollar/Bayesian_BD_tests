Scripts to infer expected confidence interval ranges of BD-test derived QTLs. Uses an approx. Bayesian framework to estimate expected range of possible "true" BD loci from two-locus QTL.

Can complement hypothesis testing (BD tests) to establish an acceptable confidence interval,based on parameters that can be adjusted by the user.
