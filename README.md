Scripts to infer expected confidence interval ranges of BD-test derived QTLs. Uses an approx. Bayesian framework to estimate expected range of possible "true" BD loci from two-locus QTL.

Can complement hypothesis testing (BD tests) to establish an acceptable confidence interval, based on statistical parameters that can be adjusted by the user using flags in both perl and python scripts in this repository.

Note: push shell scripts and chtc pipeline for simulation analysis (with example input/output) here soon - matt
